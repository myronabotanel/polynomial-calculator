# Polynomial Calculator ✨

## Overview 📝
This Java application is a **Polynomial Calculator** with a graphical user interface (**GUI**) that allows users to perform various polynomial operations, including:

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
- Derivation
- Integration  

The GUI is built using **Java Swing**, and the application follows a **well-structured MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern**.

## Features 🌟
- **Addition ➕**: Computes the sum of two polynomials.
- **Subtraction ➖**: Computes the difference between two polynomials.
- **Multiplication ✖️**: Multiplies two polynomials together.
- **Division ➗**: Performs polynomial division, returning the quotient and remainder.
- **Derivation 📈**: Computes the derivative of a polynomial.
- **Integration ∫**: Computes the integral of a polynomial.
- **User-Friendly GUI 🖥️**: Interactive interface for inputting and displaying results.

## Technologies 💻
- **Java 8+**: Core language for the application.
- **Java Swing**: Used for building the graphical user interface (GUI).
- **MVC Design Pattern**: Ensures separation of concerns between data, logic, and the view.


## Getting Started 🚀

### Prerequisites 💅
- Java 8+
- IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code with Java support)

### Installation & Running 💾
Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/polynomial-calculator.git
```
1. Open the project in your preferred IDE.
2. Run `Main.java` to start the application.

## Usage 🛠️
1. Input polynomials in the provided text fields.
2. Select an operation (Addition, Subtraction, etc.).
3. Click the corresponding button to perform the operation.
4. The result is displayed in the designated output area.

### Example 🫂
#### Input:
```
P(x) = 3x^3 + 2x^2 - x + 5
Q(x) = x^2 - 4x + 7
```
#### Addition Result:
```
R(x) = 3x^3 + 3x^2 - 5x + 12
```
